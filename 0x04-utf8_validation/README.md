## UTF8 Encoding
UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding standard used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode Transformation Format â€“ 8-bit.[1]

- UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064[a] valid Unicode code points using one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units. Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes
